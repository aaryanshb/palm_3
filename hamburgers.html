    <h1>German Hamburgers (Frikadellen)</h1>
    <h2><em>By Amy</em></h2>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Frikadellen, the original hamburger, are served like a flattened meatball with string beans and salad. I also
        like to use this recipe to make Swedish meatballs (but omit the paprika). My aunt in Hamburg, Germany, taught me
        this recipe, and I've been making it ever since. Serve with steamed string beans and tossed salad. Or serve on a
        kaiser roll with lettuce, tomato, pickled cucumbers, finely sliced deep-fried onions, and curry ketchup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kaiser roll</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the kaiser roll in a medium bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water; crumble
            into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground meats, onion, parsley, egg, paprika, salt, and black pepper to the crumbled roll; mix until well
            blended. Shape mixture into large flattened meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry the meatballs until browned and no longer pink in the
            center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
            160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
